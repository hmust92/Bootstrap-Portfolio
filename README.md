# Bootstrap Portfolio

This is my basic portfolio, however I have implemented the Bootstrap library upon it. It is a multipaged website, with an about page, a contact page, and a portfolio page.

The live link is provided in the main repo page.

To open it locally, open your terminal and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/hmust92/Bootstrap-Portfolio.git
```

After that, open it in your browser.
